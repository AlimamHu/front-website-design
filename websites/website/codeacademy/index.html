                Changing careers is a big deal. It’s not uncommon to have a few different jobs in your lifetime and want
                the next one to be better than the last. Software engineering and front-end developers are in high
                demand — but can you become a front-end developer without a degree? The answer is yes. And if you’re
                wondering whether front-end development is for you and how you might be able to upgrade your skills to
                make the switch, read on.

                We’ll share with you what a front-end developer does and what skills you will need to succeed, both in
                terms of technical skills and softer skills that are still quite important. You’ll also get the steps
                you need to showcase your skills in a resume and a portfolio, as well as a few tips on how to ace your
                technical interview.

                What does a front-end developer do?
            </h1>
            <p>

                There are three main types of developers: front-end engineers, back-end engineers, and full-stack
                engineers.

                Back-end engineers are responsible for all the hidden systems and servers that host and support websites
                and applications. Front-end engineers are the ones that develop the aspects of the website that the
                customer or end-user sees and interacts with. Full-stack engineers are those who know a little bit of
                both front-end and back-end engineering, so they could theoretically complete a project on their own
                from start to finish.

                Front-end developers get to use their knowledge of coding to create the user-facing elements of a
                website. They decide what color a button will be or how an interactive element will be displayed. They
                also get to interact with the customer to learn what they need. Front-end developers then create a
                solution using both their programming skills and some artistic or user experience skills.

                “A front-end engineer is someone that likes being at the intersection of art and logic,” says John, a
                Software Engineer at Smartsheet. You can find out more from John about what a front-end developer does
                in the video interview below.
